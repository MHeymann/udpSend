\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this project is to understand UDP and TCP for transfering files
over a network.\\\\
Reliable Blast User Datagram Protocol is a data transfer tool and protocol
specifically designed to move very large files over wide area high-speed
networks \cite{udpDef}.\\\\
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is the communication language
used for the Internet and it can also be used on private networks
\cite{tcpDef}.\\
The protocols map to a four-layer model \cite{map}:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Network Interface (Ethernet)
	\item Network (IP)
	\item Transport (TCP, UDP)
	\item Application (HTTP)
\end{enumerate}
The reliability and transfer rates of these protocols are compared.

\section{Unimplemented features}
All the specified features were implemented.

\section{Description of files}
The program consists of 12 java files.

\subsection{ShareFile.java}
ShareFile.java is the driver file for UDP transfers.

\subsection{ShareTCP.java}
ShareTCP.java is the driver file for TCP transfers.

\subsection{filereceiver}
\subsubsection{Receiver.java}
Receiver.java creates the GUI that enables receiving files with UDP.
\subsubsection{ReceiverReconstructor.java}
RecevierReconstructor.java runs on a separate threads. It receives packets
individually and order the packets by sequence numbers.
The packets are then written to a file.

\subsection{filesender}
\subsubsection{Sender.java}
Sender.java creates the GUI that enables sending files with UDP.
\subsubsection{SenderDeconstructor.java}
SenderDeconstructor.java runs on a separate thread. The files are broken up
into datagram packets with unique sequnce numbers. The packets are then sent
using UDP.

\subsection{layouts}
\subsubsection{RelativeLayout.java}
RelativeLayout.java is an external library for the general layout of the GUIs.

\subsection{packet}
\subsubsection{Packet.java}
Packet.java is a datagram packet abstraction.
\begin{itemize}
	\item int sequenceNumber
	\item int size
	\item byte[] data
\end{itemize}

\subsection{parameters}
\subsubsection{Parameters.java}
Parameters.java contains global parameters that need to be consistent
throughout the source files.

\subsection{tcpreceiver}
\subsubsection{Receiver.java}
Receiver.java creates the GUI that enables receiving files with TCP.
\subsubsection{ReceiverReconstructor.java}
RecevierReconstructor.java runs on a separate threads. It receives packets
individually and writes the packets to a file.

\subsection{tcpsender}
\subsubsection{Sender.java}
Sender.java creates the GUI that enables sending files with TCP.
\subsubsection{SenderDeconstructor.java}
SenderDeconstructor.java runs on a separate thread. The files are broken up
into packets which are sent using TCP.

\section{Program description}
sender receiver gui clients
sender sets receiver ip
set number of datagram packets get sent
Acks of datagrams sent over tcp
repeated until all packets sent
receiver acks each batch 
writes to local disk
EOF terminating signal sent which tells receiver to finalise writing of file

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Compare throughput of TCP and RBUDP data transfer}
Hoe lank dit vat 200MB

\subsection{Transfer rate of RBUDP}

\subsection{Different packet sizes in RBUDP}
buffer size Parameters.java tussen 1 en 50 000

\subsection{Varying packet loss rates}
sender deconstructor
Slows transfer 
701MB
74.81s
72.81s

\section{Issues encountered}
udp socket channel set as blocking caused gridlocks in program
very large files >2.2GB \#packets int used for % tracking wraps around.

\section{Significant data structures}
packet
priority queue packets added, ordered by sequence number

\section{Design}
fixed burst sizes instead of moving send window
java nio datagram channel

\section{Compilation and Execution}
The program contains make and run files.\\\\
To compile UDP:
\begin{verbatim}
	cd src
	./make.sh
\end{verbatim}
To compile TCP:
\begin{verbatim}
	cd src
	./maketcp.sh
\end{verbatim}
To run UDP sender:
\begin{verbatim}
	./run.sh send
\end{verbatim}
To run UDP receiver:
\begin{verbatim}
	./run.sh receive
\end{verbatim}
To run TCP sender:
\begin{verbatim}
	./runtcp.sh send
\end{verbatim}
To run TCP receiver:
\begin{verbatim}
	./runtcp.sh receive
\end{verbatim}

\section{Conclusion}
although success in reliable udp tcp still faster by orders of magnitude while also being reliable. 
int should be long int
